        Alice> Alright, I've given it some thought and have a few ideas.
        Bob> Oh, really? What do you have in mind?
        Alice> I was thinking...

    Alice:
        <- [once] I feel like having Italian.
            Bob> Mmmh, we had Italian last week, didn't we?
            Alice> Yeah, but I love it! How about pizza?
            Bob> Any other options?

        <- [once] How about sushi?
            Bob> I'm not really in the mood for sushi tonight.
            Alice> Fair enough. Let's try something else.

        - Why don't we try something new?
            Bob> Something new? Like what?
            Alice:
                - How about that new Korean BBQ place?
                    Bob> Oh, I've heard good things about it. Let's give it a shot!
                    Alice> Great, I love grilling at the table.

                - Maybe Indian food?
                    Bob> Indian sounds good. I could go for some spicy curry.
                    Alice> Perfect, let's go to Maharaja's.
                    { General.sDecidedDinner = INDIAN }

                - Surprise me!
                    Bob> Surprise you? All right, but don't blame me if you don't like it!
                    Alice> Don't worry, I trust your taste.
                    Bob> Okay, how about..

                            Bob> I've heard they have great Pad Thai.
                            Alice> Sounds good to me! Let's do it.

                            Alice> Tacos sound great! Let's go there.

        - I don't know. Maybe I should think about it a bit more.
