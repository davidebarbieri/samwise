audience:
    -- [once(bEase)] Ease of use
        audience> My question is about ease of use. Is it accessible to developers with varying technical skills?
        dave> That's a great question. Samwise has been designed with usability in mind.↵
            I've strived to make the syntax as intuitive as possible, so even developers with less experience↵
            can use it without issues. 
        dave> We've also included a series of tutorials and detailed documentation to↵
            help new users make the most of all its features.
    -- [once(bLanguages)] Supported languages
        audience> What about supported languages? Can it be used for writing dialogues in languages other than English?
        dave> Of course, Samwise supports the UTF-8 format, so it is designed to support any language.
        dave> Anyway, I must stress that it doesn't integrate a localization system.
        audience> What? Does it mean that my game will be just in a single language?
        dave> Of course not.
        dave> Samwise allows you to associate a unique id to each text line and to export all the localizable dialogue lines to↵
            a CSV or PO file to be localized later by a translator.
        dave> But, after that, localization must be applied at runtime by your favourite localization system.
    -- [once(bComplex)] Complex Narrative
        audience> Some dialogue writing tools struggle with handling complex narrative plots. How does Samwise perform in this context?
        dave> An excellent question! 
        dave> Samwise is designed to handle complex narrative plots. It supports branching dialogue trees, parallel dialogues,↵
            random paths, conditional paths, loops, variable management, and more,↵
            allowing developers to create complex and branching stories with ease.
    -- [once(bEngines)] Game Engines Integration
        audience> Very interesting. What about integration with existing game engines?
        dave> Samwise is designed to be highly flexible. You can integrate it with most existing game engines, including Unity and Unreal Engine, through dedicated APIs.
        dave> There's also a javascript library (compiled using WASM) that enable web development.
        dave> Such library is currently used in the Visual Studio Code extension too.
        { bVscode = true }
    -- [once(bVscodeChoice) & bVscode] Visual Studio Code
        audience> You mentioned there's an extension for Visual Studio Code.
        dave> Yes.
        audience> Can you give us additional details? what is it for?
        dave> Sure.
        dave> The Visual Studio code extension supports the writer in the creation of Samwise scripts.
        dave> It provides a toolbox with all the common Samwise commands, Syntax Highlighting, Error checking...
        dave> ...it also provides a player to quickly test the scripts being written.
        audience> Cool cool. Thanks.
    -- [once(bPrices)] Price
        audience> Is there a cost associated with using Samwise?
        dave> Nope, Samwise is free to use. The only requirement is to properly credits me or the tool in the game credits or anywhere else in the game.
