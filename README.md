# Samwise Dialogue System

**Samwise™** is a game development tool for writing interactive dialogues.

The objective of this tool is to empower any writer or designer to intricately craft branching narratives, offering extensive control over dialogue scripting to create truly natural interactions essential for immersive gaming experiences.

**Samwise™** consists of three components:
1. A scripting language for writing interactive dialogues;
2. A runtime library for parsing such files and supporting the execution of dialogues in a videogame (or any other interactive software);
3. A Visual Studio Code extension that assists the developer in the task of writing dialogues and testing them quickly.

## Documentation

[Here](docs/index.html) you can find the full documentation of this tool.

## How can you help me

Please consider to support my work on [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/davidebarbieri)!

I also appreciate all feedback, bug reports, and user suggestions regarding the use of Samwise. Your insights are invaluable in improving its functionality and user experience. 

However, please note that Samwise is still a personal project, and as such, **I do not accept pull requests**. While I am delighted to see Samwise being utilized in various video game projects, it remains a project driven by personal passion. Therefore, if you have suggestions for improvement, I kindly ask that you specify what aspect would you need to be enhanced rather than providing direct code contributions. This approach ensures that any modifications align with the original vision and maintains the enjoyment of the project for its creator.

## Licensing

**Samwise™** is free to be used in commercial and non-commercial products, but it requires you to attribute the work in the manner specified in the [License](LICENSE.md). For example, in order to be used in a video game it's enough to include the ["written in Samwise" logo](docs/logo/samwise-both-large.png) and/or the acknowledgment "Samwise Library™ by Davide 'PeevishDave' Barbieri" in the credits screen.

**Samwise™**'s license covers the description of the language and the runtime library, but it doesn't extend on the dialogues you write in that language. Your narrative is, of course, totally your property. 


# Acknowledgements

Even if Samwise is a text-based tool, I must acknowledge that the design of Samwise was consciously and/or unconsciously conditioned by using [Outspoken](https://www.demigiant.com/plugins/outspoken/), an awesome node-based visual editor made by **Daniele 'Demigiant' Giardini**.

I want to thank **Florent Maurin** for being the first user of Samwise, for trusting me to use my tool in one of his video games, and for giving me a lot of valuable feedback that definitely improved the quality of this tool for anyone.
