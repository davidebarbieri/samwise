# Overview

**Samwise™** is a game development tool for writing complex interactive dialogues.

The objective of this tool is to empower writers and designers to craft intricate, branching narratives, providing comprehensive control over dialogue scripting. This allows for the creation of naturally flowing interactions that are essential for immersive gaming experiences.

**Samwise™** consists of three components:
1. A scripting language for writing interactive dialogues;
2. A runtime library for parsing such files and supporting the execution of dialogues in a videogame (or any other interactive software);
3. A Visual Studio Code extension that assists the developer in the task of writing dialogues and testing them quickly.

## Licensing

**Samwise™** is free to be used in commercial and non-commercial products, but it requires you to attribute the work in the manner specified in the [License](LICENSE.md). For example, in order to be used in a video game it's enough to include the ["written in Samwise" logo](logo/samwise-both-large.png) and/or the acknowledgment "Samwise™ Dialogue System by Davide 'PeevishDave' Barbieri" in the credits screen.

**Samwise™**'s license covers the description of the language and the runtime library, but it does not extend to the dialogues you write in that language. Your narrative is, of course, entirely your property.

!> Please note that while I am delighted to see Samwise being utilized in video game projects made by other developers, it remains a personal project mainly driven by fun, and as such, **I do not accept pull requests**. If you have suggestions for improvement, I kindly ask that you specify what aspect you'd like to see enhanced rather than providing direct code contributions. This approach ensures that any modifications align with the original vision and maintain the enjoyment of the project for its creator.
