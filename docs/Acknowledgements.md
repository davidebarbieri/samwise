# Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to **Florent Maurin** for being the very first user of Samwise, for placing his trust in me by letting me integrate my tool in one of his video games even if it was the first game doing so, and for providing me with invaluable feedback that has undeniably enhanced the quality of this tool for everyone.

While Samwise is fundamentally a text-based tool, I must acknowledge that the design of Samwise was consciously and/or subconsciously influenced by using [Outspoken](https://www.demigiant.com/plugins/outspoken/), a brilliant node-based visual editor made by the awesome **Daniele 'Demigiant' Giardini**.
