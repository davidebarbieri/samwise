## Multi-line text
Samwise enables you to create multi-line text, which is useful when a single line of speech is excessively long. To ensure your line continues without breaking, you can use this special character: â†µ

To produce this character, press *Shift+Enter*.

## Toolbox

1. In the Toolbox panel, you can find shortcuts to create basic dialogue nodes quickly. As you'll notice, there's a fair number of nodes available in Samwise. Each one offers you a different tool for building your interactive narrative.
2. Click on the corresponding button to paste a node into your text.

## Preview the Dialogue in-editor

When a dialogue is selected in the text editor, the 'Player' panel of the Samwise extension allows you to launch that dialogue. You have the option to start the dialogue from the beginning or directly from the selected point.

To do this, click on the "Run" button or the "Run from Node" button.

You can also launch the Run commands via the context menu by right-clicking on a line within the text editor.

In the same panel, you will see chat balloons appear, prompting user input. These balloons serve as a preview of the dialogue in execution. By clicking on "Advance," as prompted, you can progress the flow. When you encounter a choice node, instead of the simple "Advance" button, there will be a set of buttons representing the available options.

Additionally, special dialogues, such as the challenge check dialogue, may appear during the dialogue preview. This type of dialogue allows you to simulate success or failure.
